## PhD - High Speed Silicon Optical Modulator

> [PhD Thesis (pdf)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9PEvSdE5LlRMzAwOGMxOTAtNDI0ZS00YjliLThmZmYtN2ZmNjBkNDU2NDlj/view)

The silicon photonics has emerged as the key area of research for optical telecommunications with the objective of developing an integrated transceiver fully-compatible with the available CMOS technology. In this context, the work of my thesis is focused on the structure of the optical modulator, integrated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate and for applications working at the bitrates of 10 and 40 Gbit/s. Its active structure is based on the carrier depletion obtained in a reverse biased junction and leads to an intensity modulation at the output of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The optimization of the structure produced an optical modulator design which exhibits a VpLp product of 1.7 V.cm, insertion loss as low as 3 dB and a -3 dB cutoff frequency of 35 GHz. The light and RF copropagation has been studied as well and has validated the operation of the component at the bitrate of 40 Gbit/s. A CMOS technological process has been established and chips have been fabricated at CEA/LETI then characterized at IEF. Finally, this work has led to the design of a silicon optical modulator with characteristics compatible with 40 Gbit/s applications, as well as general results for the optimization of this component. Its integration with laser sources and photodetectors will lead in the future to the emergence of silicon photonics for integrating optical telecommunications.
