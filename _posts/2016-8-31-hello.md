Writing with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) is a real pleasure. Creating a post with is better yet !

## Code highlight

Here is a code example

```javascript
// Comment
function echo(message) {
	console.log(message);
}
echo('Hello world!');
```

## MathJax

By adding the following `<script/>` tag to the template HTML, all equations are immediately rendered:

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

## Sequence diagrams

[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) allows to create extremely easily UML diagrams such as sequences or flows:

```sequence
Note left of idp: JWT server
client->idp: login
idp->client: token
client->server: /api/user\n+token
server->server: validate token
server->client: {"name":"John"}
Note right of server: OR
server->client: 403 Forbidden
```

## Flow charts

Flow charts are also a great step in describing processes.

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
